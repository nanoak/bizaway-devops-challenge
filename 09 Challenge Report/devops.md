# ☁️ The DevOps Challenge Tasks

This challenge is divided into **Required Tasks** (essential for production readiness) and **Advanced Tasks** (to showcase deeper expertise).  
We will evaluate the **quality**, **clarity**, and **security** of your solution.  
Feel free to modify the application code if it supports your DevOps goals (e.g., adding metrics endpoints).

Application sources can be found in the [challenge repository](https://bitbucket.org/bizaway/devops-tech-challenge/). 


### **1. Containerization**
Create an efficient **Dockerfile** for the NestJS application.  
Focus on **multi-stage builds** and best practices for **small, secure images**.

---

### **2. Database Initialization**
A database initialization file (e.g., `init-mongo.js`) is present in the repository.  
Integrate a mechanism (e.g., a dedicated **init container**, script, or Docker entrypoint) to automatically load this file and prepare the MongoDB schema **before the main application starts**.

---

### **3. Local Orchestration**
Create a **Docker Compose** setup for local development and demonstration.  
The setup must include:
- The **NestJS application container**
- A **MongoDB container**
- The **database initialization step** (Task 2)

---

### **4. Automation (CI/CD)**
Implement a basic **CI/CD pipeline** (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).  
The pipeline must, at minimum:
- **Build** and
- **Test** the application image successfully.

---

### **5. Security Fundamentals**
Implement solutions to **secure the application environment**, including (but not limited to):
- Managing **secrets** (e.g., in Docker Compose)
- Ensuring **secure container configuration** (non-root users, least privileges)

---

### **6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Create **Terraform** files to provision the necessary cloud infrastructure to deploy the **Kubernetes cluster** (e.g., networking, compute resources).  
Choose any major cloud provider (**AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**).

---

### **7. Kubernetes Manifests**
Create comprehensive **Kubernetes manifest files** (`Deployments`, `Services`, `ConfigMaps`, `Secrets`, etc.) for the application and its database (if self-hosted). Feel free to modify the application code if it supports your DevOps goals. 
Apply **Kubernetes best practices**, including:
- Resource **Limits/Requests**
- **Readiness/Liveness Probes**

---

### **8. Monitoring**
Implement a **Monitoring Solution** (e.g., integrating **Prometheus/Grafana/ELK + APM**) to track key application metrics such as:
- Request latency
- Error rates
- Container health

Include an example **dashboard setup or configuration**.

---

### **9. Documentation**
Document all **design choices** (why you chose a specific base image, how you handled initialization, security choices, cloud infrastructure, etc.) in a detailed `CHALLENGE_REPORT.md`.
